The Odin Project: Recipes

Overview:
Welcome to my first project; Odin Recipes. Here you'll find as what was asked, a cookbook website with links that will help the user navigate from one recipe to another. The pages with the recipes have pictures, description, an unordered list of ingredients, and an ordered list of steps on how to make them!

Key Topics Applied:
- HTML Boilerplate fundamentals
- HTML Elements and Attributes
- Functional Relative Links
- Images
- Ordered and Unordered lists
